package library.application;

/**
 * Tells whoever is listening that the library changed. A driven port with one method
 * and no arguments: the core calls it after every command that completed, and it says
 * that something changed, not what. The adapter decides what to do with that, and the
 * usual answer is to ask the queries again. This is the pull form of the Observer
 * pattern, and what Fowler calls an event notification: the smallest message that can
 * cross, carrying no state for the two sides to disagree about. Whether anyone
 * listens, and how many, is the configurator's business; a driver that does not care
 * plugs in a lambda that does nothing. It is declared in this ring because the
 * application services are its only callers; the two rings inside do not know it
 * exists.
